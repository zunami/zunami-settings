# When someone rings the doorbell (Reolink camera), a popup is triggered on my wall-mounted dashboard tablet using Browser Mod in Home Assistant.
# The popup displays a live camera view from the doorbell, allowing us to quickly see who's at the door.
# It appears automatically, doesn't close on its own, and uses the fullscreen option for better visibility.
