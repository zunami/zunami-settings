# i wanted the tablet, which is connected to a bluetooth speaker, to play a radio stream.
# i constantly had problems to realize this, because it always tried to find a streaming cast in the network.
# but there was none, because the tablet, on which the dashboard was displayed, was directly connected to bluetooth. 
# solution android home assistant app enabled more rights in the basic android settings. also assigned rights in the app settings themselves.
# named the device correctly in the settings. then installed the HACS mini-media-player extension and with this YAML on the dashboard it worked.
